whenever you want git to ignores a file from the control version from a local repo, you use the git ignore file
in order to do so
Usually, git is used to control version and share code files, so there are file format which are not intended to be added for various resasons.

just enter to the git ignore the files you want to be ignored
1 - by name: .ds_store
2 - by format: *.exe (all .exe files are to be ignored)

These works for files and folders
